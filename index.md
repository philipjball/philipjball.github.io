I'm Phil, a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, where I've been a core contributor on [Genie 2](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/) and [Genie 3](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/). I'm interested in generative video models, high fidelity world models, and machine learning that survives the test of scale.

Before this I was a PhD student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. [Steve Roberts](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) in the [Machine Learning Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/). I've completed internships at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) and at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/). I've also been fortunate enough to work with Prof. [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) as a visiting student at [RAIL Lab](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.

Previously I was an [AI Resident](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/) at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I have Masters Degrees in [Machine Learning](http://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) and [Engineering Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science) from the Universities of [Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk) and [Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk) respectively. In a previous life, I was a Management Consultant at [Accenture](https://accenture.com).

In my spare time I like to play the [bass guitar](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhilPlaysBass) and read. I can also speak Mandarin to a relatively fluent level, which has led me to work for extended periods of time in China and Hong Kong.
