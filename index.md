I'm Phil, a 4th year DPhil/PhD Student at the University of Oxford. My main area of academic interest is improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. I've also dabbled in generative modelling and [algorithmic fairness](/pdfs/thesis.pdf). I'm supervised by Prof. [Steve Roberts](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) in the [Machine Learning Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/). I've completed internships at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), investigating interpretibility and uncertainty calibration in deep-learning, and at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), working on continual learning through the lens of network compression. I've also been fortunate enough to work with Prof. [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and Dr. [Ilya Kostrikov](https://www.kostrikov.xyz/) as a visiting student at [RAIL Lab](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.

Previously I was an [AI Resident](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/) at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) where I worked on Deep RL for video games and automatic knowledge base creation. I have Masters Degrees in [Machine Learning](http://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) and [Engineering Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science) from the Universities of [Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk) and [Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk) respectively. In a previous life, I was a Management Consultant at [Accenture](https://accenture.com).

In my spare time I like to play the [bass guitar](https://www.youtube.com/user/PhilPlaysBass) and read. I can also speak Mandarin to a relatively fluent level, which has led me to work for extended periods of time in China and Hong Kong.
